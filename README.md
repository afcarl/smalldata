# smalldata

A curated list of resources for beginner-level data manipulation in Python.

Please help flesh it out with suggestions of more resources!

Rather than a list of data-handling or data science resources in 
general, which would be very long and not very useful, I want to 
produce a list specifically helpful to very new Python learners 
and those helping them learn.
